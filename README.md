## Course Description and General Information

This course addresses how to analyze, visualize and draw conclusions from biological data. It introduces basic concepts in statistics and the intuition behind them interwoven with training in data analysis using the R computing environment. Students will learn to identify underlying data structures and wrangle data. Students will also learn to effectively convey results using statistical graphics. Topics include basic R programming, data exploration, t-tests, statistical modeling, parameter estimation and interpretation, and model comparison. This class particularly focuses on biological data.

There will be a series of problem sets, which will each be posted on the course website a week before they are due. Problem sets must be submitted following the instructions posted with them. You are welcome to work with other students or use any outside resources when completing problem sets, but each student must submit their own written responses unless otherwise explicitly indicated in the problem set. Students enrolled at the graduate level will produce a final project report detailing a specific biological research question, statistical methods and results and will present their final project to the class at the end of the semester.

## Course Material

There is no single textbook for the course. There will be multiple references, mostly free textbooks or materials available online. All required readings and supplementary materials will be posted on the course website. All code and data files will also be posted on the course canvas site. Code and data files will typically be made available before class meetings; slides will be posted afterwards.
