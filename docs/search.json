    "text": "This course addresses how to analyze, visualize and draw conclusions from biological data. It introduces basic concepts in statistics and the intuition behind them interwoven with training in data analysis using the R computing environment. Students will learn to identify underlying data structures and wrangle data. Students will also learn to effectively convey results using statistical graphics. Topics include basic R programming, data wrangling using modern tidyverse packages, t-tests, statistical modeling (linear regression, dose response curves). This class is targeted towards biologists, hence focuses on biological data for examples and omits rigorous statistical formulas. No prior experience with R required.\nThere will be a series of problem sets posted on the course website with instructions a week before they are due. You are encouraged to work with other students or use any outside resources when completing problem sets, but each student must submit their own written responses unless otherwise explicitly indicated in the problem set. Any group submissions or work should include attribution section detailing who did what.

However, if you are unable to attend class in-person, please contact me in advance to avail the zoom option. There is no penalty for mussing upto 3 classes, additional absences will proportionally reduce the attendance part of the final grade.\nAside from excused absences, you are permitted to absences for religious holidays that are not included in the list of Federal and Academic holidays. Please let me know if you will be absent due to a religious holiday.\n\n\n\nYou are automatically entitled to two late submissions throughout the course. Any additional late submissions have a penalty of 10% of the grade for that assignment. If you need any accommodations please email the instructor.\nIn addition, the policy for religious holidays under Attendance extends into late submissions - if you have a religious holiday that occurs on the day of or the day before an assignment is due, please let me know and I can provide an additional extension.\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to email me at any time with your questions, concerns, and appointment requests. To ensure that I do not miss your email, please include [course ID]-[short summary of the query] in the email subject. For example, if you are requesting an additional appointment, the email subject should be: [course ID]-scheduling appointment.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a different name or gender pronoun than the one displayed on Canvas, please let me know. All students are expected to refer to each other by their correct names and pronouns during class. When addressing groups of people, use gender-neutral language. Here is a resource to assist you with inclusive, respectful language: Pronouns.\n\n\n\nIn addition, no racist vocabulary will be permitted in class in any capacity. Please refer to each other with respect.\n\n\n\nIf you face any challenges in securing personal or educational resources, such as a safe space and uninterrupted access to computing or the internet, and believe that these challenges may impact your performance in this class, please notify me. I will work with you to ensure that I can assist in any way possible.\n\n\n\nIn the event of extreme weather conditions that impact your ability to get to class in person, please inform me and I will announce opening the zoom to everyone for that day/class\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\n\nAny collaborative work or help received should be duly acknowledge in the report under attributions section. For group submissions, please detail who did what for the assignment/report.\nIt is ideal to pre-determine how the work will be split by writing down the attribution section initially to prevent any confusion among the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111, adarice@rice.edu, x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\nFurthermore, if you require course materials to be delivered in an alternate way to online .pdfs, please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course was taught by Prof. Lydia Beadrout for 6 years and materials from the spring 2023 course were heavily relied upon to create the current course. Classroom policies for this page were verbatim borrowed from my wife, Swetha Sridhar."

I will work with you to ensure that I can assist in any way possible.\n\n\n\nIn the event of extreme weather conditions that impact your ability to get to class in person, please inform me and I will announce opening the zoom to everyone for that day/class\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\n\nAny collaborative work or help received should be duly acknowledge in the report under attributions section. For group submissions, please detail who did what for the assignment/report.\nIt is ideal to pre-determine how the work will be split by writing down the attribution section initially to prevent any confusion among the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111, adarice@rice.edu, x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\nFurthermore, if you require course materials to be delivered in an alternate way to online .pdfs, please let me know."
