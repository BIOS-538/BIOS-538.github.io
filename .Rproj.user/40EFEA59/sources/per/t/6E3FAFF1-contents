# Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5

# Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50

# Create a sequence of numbers from 50 to 100 in increments of 5.

# Assign the sequence to an object named My_sequence

# What is the mean of the sequence? 

# What is the median of the sequence?

# Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 that repeats 10 times

# Create a repeating sequence of numbers from 7 to 3 that has 44 numbers in it

# Assign the repeating sequence from the previous question to an object named My_repeats

# What is the sum of the 44 numbers from the previous question?

# What is the log base 10 of 100?

# Use code to generate a TRUE or FALSE response for the following:
# a) 10 is less than 20
# b) 400 is greater than 500
# c) the square root of 4 is equal to 1 plus 1
# d) the square root of the absolute value of -9 is not equal to 7
# e) the median of 1:5 is three

# Create an object called "my_name" that has your full name in it. 

# a) Create an object named ZZ that contains the product of 15 and 25
# b) Create another object named YY that has the difference of 100 and 20
# c) What is the sum of ZZ and YY?
