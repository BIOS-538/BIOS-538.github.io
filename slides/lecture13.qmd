# Recap

Last class covered

-   How normal distributions are generated : Sum of random variables / `mean` of a random sample

-   Used R to simulate random events and explore distributions

# Today's class

-   *Finish segment* : How do I [test](https://www.statology.org/test-for-normality-in-r/) if my data is normal? `q-q plots` and `Shapiro-Wilk` test

-   What questions do t-tests answer?

-   t-tests dissected: Layout of a general hypothesis test

-   Understand sampling distributions, Standart error of mean (SEM) and confidence intervals

# Checking for normality

How to check if my data is normally distributed?

-   We need metrics that give us the shape of the distribution without having to plot the distribution and staring at it

## Quantiles tell us about the distribution shape

> **quantiles** are cut points dividing the [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics) "Range (statistics)") of a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") into continuous intervals with equal probabilities. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile)

probability distribution = `geom_density` plot. Hence quantiles divide the range to make equal area under the `geom_density` curve

## `Q-Q` plot enables comparison of distribution shapes

## Formal `Shapiro-Wilk` test for normality

What is this testing for?

# What are t-tests for?

To make statistical conclusions of this kind based on data

-   "Smoking **causes** cancer"

But causality is really really hard to establish, that is why we talk about [correlation/association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)

-   "Smoking **is associated with** cancer"

-   "Smokers are **statistically significantly** at a higher risk of having cancer"

> "Evidence **linking** smoking and cancer appeared in the 1920s." Source: [The cigarette controversy, 2007](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/16/6/1070/260310/The-Cigarette-Controversy#10539424)/section: *Smoking Causes Cancer: When Did They Know?*

## t-tests finds statistical support against a NULL hypothesis

In real terms - "smoking is **NOT** associated with cancer"

In statistical terms - "the samples of smokers and non-smokers came from the **same population**"

-   (*assumption)* For a t-test, this source population is normally distributed

-   *(Other assumptions)* Equal variance between smoker dataset and non-smoker dataset (this can be violated for the `welch t-test`)

# Sampling distributions

1.  Sample multiple times from a population and plot one parameter (such as `mean`)
2.  Plot the parameter, which is in-itself a random variable. Hence results in a different value for each sample
3.  This results in a distribution
    -   `mean` is nice because it follows a normal distribution (due to the *central limit theorem*!)
4.  The properties of this distribution are helpful to understand the population which is what we are interested in

# Summary

-   `q-q plots` and `Shapiro-Wilk` test enable checking data for normality

-   t-tests answer questions of association such as '*smoking causes cancer*'

-   t-test = **p-value** gives the probability that the NULL hypothesis: *that both data groups were sampled from the same distribution* is `TRUE`

-   Understand sampling distributions, Standart error of mean (SEM) and confidence intervals
