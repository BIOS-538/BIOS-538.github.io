# Recap?

# Today's class

-   What is `ggplot()` and why is it awesome?

-   Think of a plot / graph as having multiple layers

-   ..

## Building a plot layer by layer

## Geom layers

There's many more geoms in the [ggplot cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)!

Let us quickly see an animation of empty plot, adding axes, adding data for the histogram

## Empty plot: `ggplot()` call

```{r demo1, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
data("mtcars")

ggplot(data = mtcars)

```

## Adding axes: `mapping = aes()`

```{r demo2, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = mpg))
```

## Adding points: `geom_point()`

```{r demo3, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Adding line: `geom_line()`

```{r demo4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

# Onto the worksheet now

Please download the \_class8_ggplot_worksheet.Rmd or the `.R` file with the same name from the syllabus website

-   the `.Rmd` will make it easier to read the prompts and run code by clicking on the "play" button (*run current chunk*) for each chunk

-   If you are not comfortable with this, you can use the `.R` file instead with the same content
