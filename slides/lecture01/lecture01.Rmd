# A little bit about myself

--
- Grew up in India, finished undergrad there 
(_knew some C back then_)
--

- Did a Masters in Biomedical Engg. at Johns Hopkins
(_I used python back then_)
--

- Recently finished PhD. in Systems, Synthetic and Physical biology at Rice
(_These days, I use R, commandline etc._)
--


## How I got into R for data analysis?
- How do I save effort by **automating** data analysis for **repeated experiments**

--
I ran 50 sets of qPCR during my Ph.D.
- Need the same analysis on all of them
  - Attach sample names to data
  - Calibrate values to a standard curve
  - Plot graph, label axes, make it pretty
- Now did the same for other datasets
  - bacterial growth data : plate reader
  - Flow cytometry

# Rice Honour Code

## List the author contributions for all team projects
- A good idea is to divide tasks first thing and write them down before starting action
  - Is a great tip for when beginning a collaborative research project as well
  - Minimizes skirmishes when publishing papers

???

Similar concept to pre-determining a statistical plan before beginning to collect data

#  R is quite beginner friendly 

**Key point**: You don’t have to be a great R programmer to use R effectively and do some amazing things, but you do have to be an excellent programmer to do the same things in other programs
