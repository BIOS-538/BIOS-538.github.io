# Note: Everything after the "#" is a human readable comment that R ignores


# Simple datatypes ----
# Note: The 4 dashes make a new section, check outline button on the top right of the script pane
# two hashes ## with the 4 dashes make a subsection!


## Numbers ----

x <- 2.5 # assign a number to variable x

# complete comments on each of the following lines after running them
class(x)

is.integer(x)

### numeric operations ----

2 + 3 # addition
# try exponent (^), and remainder (%%) operators

# R reads these operations like any other function: f(x, y)
`+`(2, 3)
`>`(2, 3)


# TIP: Use up and down arrows in the "Console" to move around in your history


# Your turn now:
# a) Add today's month plus day plus year
# b) Multiply the number of letters in the alphabet by 5
