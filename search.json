    "text": "This course addresses how to analyze, visualize and draw conclusions from biological data. It introduces basic concepts in statistics and the intuition behind them interwoven with training in data analysis using the R computing environment. Students will learn to identify underlying data structures and wrangle data. Students will also learn to effectively convey results using statistical graphics. Topics include basic R programming, data wrangling using modern tidyverse packages, t-tests, statistical modeling (linear regression, dose response curves). This class is targeted towards biologists, hence focuses on biological data for examples and omits rigorous statistical formulas. No prior experience with R required.\nThere will be a series of problem sets posted on the course website with instructions a week before they are due. You are encouraged to work with other students or use any outside resources when completing problem sets, but each student must submit their own written responses unless otherwise explicitly indicated in the problem set. Any group submissions or work should include attribution section detailing who did what.

That said, the examples we walk through in class and working on the assignments (with help from very enthusiastic TAs) will be great resources to guide the learning process.\nThis classroom is a safe space, so no question is too simple or too “silly” to ask. And you would definitely have to put in the work outside of class to pickup the basics of programming quickly and attend office hours/use the discussion board to get help when you are stuck for too long on one thing.\n\n\n\nPracticing by working through code at your own time is the only way to actually learn coding. If you are lagging behind in class, the office hours and discussion board will be quite valuable\n\n\n\n\nThere is no single textbook for the course. There will be multiple references, mostly from free textbooks or materials available online. All required readings and supplementary materials will be posted on the course website. All code and data files will also be posted on the course canvas site. Code and data files will typically be made available before class meetings; slides will be posted afterwards.\n\n\n\nTextbook to skim: Hands on programming with R: For non-programmers, friendly intro to R with consistent examples of dice rolls throughout the book. Load data, navigate R, write functions.\nUse the search button to lookup data types and functions: Advanced R: (Hadley Wickham): Improvement for R users/other language programmers.

However, if you are unable to attend class in-person, please contact me in advance to avail the zoom option. There is no penalty for mussing upto 3 classes, additional absences will proportionally reduce the attendance part of the final grade.\nAside from excused absences, you are permitted to absences for religious holidays that are not included in the list of Federal and Academic holidays. Please let me know if you will be absent due to a religious holiday.\n\n\n\nYou are automatically entitled to two late submissions throughout the course. Any additional late submissions have a penalty of 10% of the grade for that assignment. If you need any accommodations please email the instructor.\nIn addition, the policy for religious holidays under Attendance extends into late submissions - if you have a religious holiday that occurs on the day of or the day before an assignment is due, please let me know and I can provide an additional extension.\n\n\n\nYou are welcome to email me at any time with your questions, concerns, and appointment requests. To ensure that I do not miss your email, please include [course ID]-[short summary of the query] in the email subject. For example, if you are requesting an additional appointment, the email subject should be: BIOS 538: scheduling appointment.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a different name or gender pronoun than the one displayed on Canvas, please let me know. All students are expected to refer to each other by their correct names and pronouns during class. When addressing groups of people, use gender-neutral language. Here is a resource to assist you with inclusive, respectful language: Pronouns.\n\n\n\nIn addition, no racist vocabulary will be permitted in class in any capacity. Please refer to each other with respect.\n\n\n\nIf you face any challenges in securing personal or educational resources, such as a safe space and uninterrupted access to computing or the internet, and believe that these challenges may impact your performance in this class, please notify me. I will work with you to ensure that I can assist in any way possible.\n\n\n\nIn the event of extreme weather conditions that impact your ability to get to class in person, please inform me and I will announce opening the zoom to everyone for that day/class\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution. If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook. This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.\n\n\n\nAny collaborative work or help received should be duly acknowledge in the report under attributions section. For group submissions, please detail who did what for the assignment/report.\nIt is ideal to pre-determine how the work will be split by writing down the attribution section initially to prevent any confusion among the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111, adarice@rice.edu, x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.\nFurthermore, if you require course materials to be delivered in an alternate way to online .pdfs, please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course was taught by Prof. Lydia Beadrout for 6 years and materials from the spring 2023 course were heavily relied upon to create the current course. Classroom policies for this page were verbatim borrowed from my wife, Swetha Sridhar."

And you would definitely have to put in the work outside of class to pickup the basics of programming quickly and attend office hours/use the discussion board to get help when you are stuck for too long on one thing.\n\n\n\nPracticing by working through code at your own time is the only way to actually learn coding. If you are lagging behind in class, the office hours and discussion board will be quite valuable"
