# Last class

## Today's class

# What is a random number?

Coin toss - put image

Dice rolls - put image

Are these truly random?

# Can something be more or less random?

yes!

-   it depends on how the various options that the random number takes

-   How often they repeat

-   *Show runs of 1,2,3.. : ask which is more random. Show histogram*

-   *the maximum uncertainity distribution is uniform ; but think of any arbitrary shape..*
