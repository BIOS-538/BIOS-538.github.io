# A little bit about myself

--
- Grew up in India, finished undergrad there 
  - _knew some C programming back then_
--

- Did a Masters in Biomedical Engg. at Johns Hopkins
  - _I used python here_
--

- Recently finished Ph.D. in Systems, Synthetic and Physical biology at Rice
  - _These days, I use R and other command line tools_
--


## How I got into R for data analysis?
- Trying to save effort by **automating** data analysis for **repeated experiments**
  - Ended up spending too much time coding in R
  - So I have to transfer my R skills before I leave Rice `r emo::ji('wink')`

---
# Was it useful to analyze my data in R?
Verdict : Yes, definitely!

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- Ran **50 qPCRs** during Ph.D.
- Repetitive analysis required
  - Attach sample names
  - Calibrate: standard curve
  - Plot graph, label axes

.pull-right[
- I have similar R pipelines for other datasets too
  - bacterial growth data : plate reader
  - Flow cytometry

# What can you expect to learn from this class? 

- To use R to Load, process and analyze data 
  - Making nice plots with `ggplot()` and reproducible reports with `Rmarkdown` / `quarto`
- The intuition behind statistical tests _without going into rigorous mathematics_
- To critically evaluate statistics published in papers

# Detailed syllabus and resources

Here's the course website where you can find the detailed syllabus and lesson plan for every class
- Put website

_Please keep in mind that this syllabus is tentative and we will add or remove sections based on your feedback and how the class is doing_

TODO : put a table with the syllabus here

---
# Textbooks?


---
# Grading 

TODO : put grading scheme here

## Opportunities for extra credit
- TODO : add stuff
- Editing a Wikipedia article

---
# Rice Honour Code

--
## List the author contributions for all team projects
- A good idea is to divide tasks first thing and write them down before starting action
  - Is a great tip for when beginning a collaborative research project as well
  - Minimizes skirmishes when publishing papers

???

Similar concept to pre-determining a statistical plan before beginning to collect data

#  What is R? 

- Free, open source software
--

- Composed of a “base” R system and other packages for specific enhancements or tasks

--
- Vibrant user community creates new tools

#  R is quite beginner friendly `r emo::ji('smile')`

**Key point**: You don’t have to be a great R programmer to use R effectively and do some amazing things, unlike many other programs

## Best way to learn R is by using it
- Practice by doing problem sets
- Pursuing hobby questions
- Analyzing your own data
  - Works great when there is no deadline ;)

#  Limitations of R 

Avoid R for any large data sets (_NGS sequencing type_) since R is quite memory hungry and likes to keep too much in the RAM

- Requires learning new language
- Documentation of variable quality
- Packages of variable quality
- Inconsistencies among packages
- Memory hungry

The CRAN website houses many R packages

#  History of R 

R language first developed in 1991 as an open-source alternative to “S”, which was only available in “S-PLUS” commercial software
R Core Development Team formed in 1997
R version 1.0.0 release to public in 2000

#  What is RStudio? 

![](img/image4.png)
- Free, open source integrated development environment (IDE) for R
- ie.) Rstudio is the software we use to interact with R programs and their outputs such as data and plots
- Rstudio is run by [Posit.co](https://posit.co/), a [Bcorp](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/rstudio/) committed to open-source movement
  - Posit employs quite a few developers who make excellent packages for R, including the amazing [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem of packages
<!-- - First public version in 2011 -->
