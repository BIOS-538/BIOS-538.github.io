Course website is here - <https://bios-538.github.io/>\n\nNote:\n\n*From the feedback we have so far and hearing from students, I see quite a few people feel overwhelmed. I hope the next 3 slides that clarify lecture format and assignments will help encourage people to stay on.*\n\n## How challenging will it be if I am very new to `R`? {.smaller}\n\nI believe that if you have one undergraduate level course where you **learnt** to code in **any programming language**, it should not be too challenging to pickup `R` syntax with 3 weeks of practice.\n\n. . .\n\nThat said, the examples we walk through in class and working on the assignments (*with help from very enthusiastic TAs*) will be great resources to guide the learning process.\n\nThis classroom is a safe space, so no question is too simple or too \"silly\" to ask.\n\n## There are too many assignments, seems like a lot of work? {.smaller}\n\nThe lectures are structured to be interspersed with **5-10 min** coding sessions where we will walk everyone through stuff. You essentially save all the work we did in class, and add to that by working on your own time for the assignments.\n\nSo 25% of the assignment will already be done in class!\n\n. . .\n\nPracticing by working through code at your own time is the only way to actually learn coding.\n\n## Assignment logistics\n\n-   *Thursday*: Assignment uploaded and introduced in class\n\n-   Get help in office hours during the week\n\n-   ***Friday 7 pm***: submission\n\n-   *Next Thursday*: Brief discussion on the previous week's assignment, common mistakes\n\n-   *Next Saturday*: receive your grades and feedback from TAs\n\n## Would I be bored in the first 2 lectures if I already know stuff? {.smaller}\n\nPlease do finish the coding task at hand even if it seems too easy. *There surely will be a thing or two you haven't noticed before to learn!*\n\n. . .\n\nTry to help your peers and neighbors during the class.\n\n-   *if you want to do this at scale, ie) for multiple lectures / be open for other students reaching out, contact me and you will get extra credit with a micro TA designation* ðŸ˜‰\n\n. . .\n\n**BONUS CONTENT** : We will also have some bonus content that is a good challenge for you to work on during the class (*once you finish the regular task, of course*)\n\n## Fun fact: Don't put full email IDs on the internet\n\nDo you know why?\n\n![](img/email_funfact.png){width=\"272\"}\n\n## Today's class\n\nAnalyze data like in the B.C.E times (*before computers era!*)\n\n. . .\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\nNot this way. *this is number theory*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/ancient_abacus.jpg){fig-alt=\"Ancient abacus\" width=\"188\"} [^1]\n:::\n:::\n\n[^1]: Dall-E3, via MS Bing\n\n. . .\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\nThis way *for statistics*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A[Data population     ] --> B(Sampling    ) --> C(Distribution    ) --> D[Analyses     ]\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n# Some background terms\n\n## What is a random number?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nCoin toss\n\n![random variable = \\[Heads\\] or \\[Tails\\]](img/coin_toss.jpg){fig-alt=\"coin tossing hand\" width=\"196\"} [^2]\n\noutcomes: \\[Heads/Tails\\]\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nDice rolls\n\n![random variable = \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\]](img/dice.png){width=\"406\"} [^3]\n\noutcomes: \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\]\n:::\n:::\n\n[^2]: By ICMA Photos - Coin Toss, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=71147286\n\n[^3]: germansektor.blogspot.com\n\n::: aside\nAre these truly random?\n\n*hint: most classical physics processes can be predicted using Newton's laws!*\n:::\n\n*Side point*: Are these truly random?\n\n## Can it be more or less random? {.smaller}\n\nYes!

But in general, think of any arbitrary shape for a distribution for better understanding of the term **distribution**.*\n:::\n\n# Statistics activity {.smaller}\n\n**Merges into the assignment**: Take a photo of your distribution chart at the end of each task. And these photos with one or two sentences that indicate your understanding are the assignment for this week!\n\n**Data**: We generated \"populations\" of data from 3 different distributions. For the final task, you can compare your data with another groups data from a different population for best results.\n\n## Logistics {.smaller}\n\n-   We need 9 volunteers to sample the data for the 9 groups\n\n-   Each group will get 30 data points ; while everyone is forming teams (5+ members/team)\n\n-   I will briefly demo how to arrange them into a histogram\n\n**How to form a good team?**\n\n-   Get to know new people in the class!\n\n    -   ex: me, 2 of my friends, 2 new people\n\n-   If you know a tiny bit of R, make new friends who are new to R\n\n## Let us start forming teams now!\n\nTeams\n\n-   5 mins to form teams\n\n-   5 mins to get to know each other\n\n    -   Where are you from?\n\n    -   What field are you in?\n\nData seekers\n\n-   TAs will explain the process now\n\n## task 1. Histogram: distribute the data into bins\n\nshow demo: \\~ 5-10 data points\n\n-   Choose bin widths for your histogram. I recommend 0.25, 0.5, 1.\n\n-   Once you have a histogram, mark the outlines (*top shape*) of the distribution\n\n    -   Take the marker pen from first bench and mark the topmost data and the chart paper above it as well\n\n## task 2. Find central values {.smaller}\n\nA single value that can describe the whole distribution (*to an approximation*)\n\nMark each of these quantities visually on the chart below the distribution (*approximate location works*)\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **Mode**: the most repeated value / bin in this case\n\n-   **Median**: center most value when data is ordered\n\n-   **Mean**: average (sum/ number of data points)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/visualisation_mode_median_mean.png){fig-alt=\"wikipedia visual showing mode, median and mean\" width=\"234\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## task 3. Standard Deviation: spread of data around the mean\n\n-   Ask the TA or your group's R experts to give you the `sd()` output and note it down.\n\n-   Visually demarcate the `Mean +/- SD` and `Mean +/- 2 x SD` locations on the chart.\n\n-   Count the number of points within the `1 SD` and `2 SD` intervals\n\n## task 4.1 Hypothesis testing: are two different samples identical?\n\n**Merging the distributions**: Is a visual way to tell if two distributions are similar or not.\n\n-   Befriend a neighboring group with a different colour of datapoints and merge your histograms into a single chart.\n\n-   Together both teams will assemble two histograms in the same chart (*start from any groups*) ; and mark the tops of the guest group for easy visualization\n\n## task 4.2 Hypothesis testing: are two different samples identical? {.smaller}\n\n**Quantitative value**: But we need to depend on more concrete statistics than gut feeling, hence we do hypothesis testing using t.tests.\n\n**Null hypothesis**: You start with the hypothesis that both samples are from the same distribution *i.e.) they are essentially identical*. And you try to find quantitative evidence to reject this (*\\~ disproving the null hypothesis*)\n\n-   Using `R`'s `t.test()`function: Get the TAs or your group's R experts to calculate this for you and note down the values.\n\n    -   Also do another test comparing to another group from the same population.\n\n-   Rule of thumb: if the `p.value < 0.05` ; then the data-sets have very little likelihood of being sampled from the same distribution.\n\n## How does the population you sampled from look like?\n\nIt was \\~normally distributed, and standard deviations were all the same hence assumptions for doing `t.test` were met!\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/lec2_histogram.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](img/lec2_density.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n# Summary\n\n## Today's class summarized\n\n-   We distribute data into **bins** to form a **histogram.**\n\n-   The complexity in each individual data can be simplified by describing it with just a central tendancy *+/-* spread (as a measure of variability).\n\n    -   Mean +/- Standard Deviation\n\n-   We **compare** two (*or more..*) distributions of data using hypothesis tests, by starting with a **null hypothesis** and finding evidence against it.\n\n## Reminder: assignment 1\n\nTake the data-points and the chart with you and explore more while doing the assignment. *Note: Groups are working together, but we want each individual to turn-in their own report so they get better understanding while writing*\n",
